# Peer Taught
Software Development Methods and Tools Project

Worked collaboratively with team members through a complete agile software development process creating a web resource called "Peer Taught" for CU students to connect with their peers, create study groups, ask questions, and find resources in one hub. The project implemented front-end design and construction using HTML \& CSS, back-end database design and construction, full-stack integration, and cloud-based application deployment.
